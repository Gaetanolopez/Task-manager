This code is a simple task management system that allows users to add, view, and complete tasks.

The system uses two text files, "tasks.txt" and "user.txt" to store data.

"tasks.txt" holds task details including assigned username, task title and description, due date, and completion status. 

"user.txt" stores information about users, including their username and password.

The code first imports the os and datetime libraries and sets a string format for datetime.

It then checks if the "tasks.txt" file exists, and if it does not, creates an empty one.

It then reads the contents of "tasks.txt" and creates a list of task dictionaries from it.

Similarly, it checks if the "user.txt" file exists, and if it does not, creates a default account.

It also has functions that allow the user to register, add a new task and view current tasks.
